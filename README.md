# Instructions
Just clone and build

# Things I would change 
- Convert TableView to CollectionView. A grid would make more sense for the data I think
- I'd move the sorting/filtering options from an AlertController to a custom view that looks nicer

# Additonal notes
I used the Kingfisher library for image caching
